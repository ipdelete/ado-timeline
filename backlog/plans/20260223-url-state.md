# URL State for Shareable Views

## Summary

Persist UI state (expanded card, iteration filter, search/filters) in the URL hash so views are bookmarkable and shareable.

## Motivation

Currently, refreshing the page loses the expanded card and filter selections. Users can't share a link that shows a specific work item expanded or a specific iteration filtered. URL state makes the dashboard feel more like a real tool.

## Proposal

### Goals

- Expanded card ID persisted in URL hash (e.g., `#item=4521`)
- Iteration filter persisted (e.g., `#iter=Sprint+14`)
- URL updates without page reload via `history.replaceState` or hash changes
- Page load reads hash and restores state

### Non-Goals

- Full routing framework
- Browser back/forward navigation between states (nice-to-have, not required)

## Design

Use `URLSearchParams` on `location.hash.slice(1)` to read/write state. On card toggle and filter change, update the hash. On `init()`, parse the hash and apply state before first render. Keep it simple — just key=value pairs in the hash fragment.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `syncStateToUrl()` helper that writes uiState to hash
- [ ] Add `readStateFromUrl()` helper that parses hash into state
- [ ] Call `readStateFromUrl()` during `init()` before first render
- [ ] Update `toggleCard()`/`collapseCard()` to sync URL
- [ ] Update iteration dropdown change handler to sync URL
