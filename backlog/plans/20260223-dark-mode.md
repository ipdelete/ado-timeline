# Dark Mode via prefers-color-scheme

## Summary

Add automatic dark mode that respects the user's OS preference, using CSS custom properties already defined in `:root`.

## Motivation

The app is light-only. Developers often work in dark environments, and the bright white background is jarring when switching from a dark IDE or terminal. Since all colors already flow through CSS custom properties, dark mode is a matter of overriding variable values.

## Proposal

### Goals

- Dark mode activates automatically via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
- All colors override the existing `:root` custom properties
- Status dots, badges, and cards remain visually distinct in dark theme

### Non-Goals

- Manual toggle switch (can be added later)
- Per-component dark overrides — only CSS variable reassignment

## Design

Add a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block at the end of styles.css that redefines `:root` variables with dark values. Key mappings: `--bg` → dark gray, `--card-bg` → slightly lighter gray, `--text` → light gray, `--border` → darker border. Badge and dot colors need slight saturation/brightness adjustments for contrast on dark backgrounds.

## Tasks

- [ ] Define dark color palette mapping for all `:root` variables
- [ ] Add `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block to styles.css
- [ ] Adjust badge colors for sufficient contrast on dark backgrounds
- [ ] Adjust dot colors for visibility against dark timeline rail
- [ ] Test with OS dark mode enabled across card states
